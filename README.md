# Proto Challenge 2021/2022

## What is the Proto Challenge

It is a competitive challenge for business innovation organized by HIT (Hub Innovazione Trentino) Foundation which allows the manufacturing world to compete with the most promising talents of Trentino research and the University of Trento to optimize and innovate its mechanical components.

For about two months, different teams of students, supported by industry experts, work on the analysis and redesign of products proposed by companies selected on a competitive basis, using advanced software, carrying out analysis, topological optimization and industrial redesign in an additive key.

At the end of the Challenge, the work done is presented by the groups and evaluated by a selected jury.

## Challenge of my group

My group and I worked on the thermal optimization of a product under development by **Elixe srl** company, i.e. a UV led lamp used for the polymerization of
coatings inside tight spaces of metal artifacts, such as small diameters pipes or tubes to be used in oil wells for instance or heat exchangers and pressurized gas cylinders.
